## Origins at Acorn Computers (1983-1990)

### The BBC Micro Success
In the early 1980s, Acorn Computers was riding high on the success of the BBC Micro, a computer that had captured the UK education market. However, the company's leadership knew they needed more powerful processors for their next generation of computers.

### The Birth of ARM
In 1983, Acorn began developing what would become the ARM processor. The project was led by Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber, who were inspired by the Berkeley RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) research papers. Their goal was ambitious: create a processor that was both powerful and efficient, suitable for a desktop computer but with minimal power consumption.

### Key Innovations
The original Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) processor, completed in 1985, featured several groundbreaking innovations:
- **32-bit architecture** with a 26-bit address space
- **No microcode** - all instructions executed directly in hardware
- **Conditional execution** on most instructions, reducing branch penalties
- **Simple, elegant design** with only 25,000 transistors (compared to 275,000 in Intel's 80386)
- **Extremely low power consumption** - the first ARM1 samples worked without their power pins connected, running entirely on leakage current from the I/O pins!

### The Archimedes Computer: World's First RISC Home Computer
In June 1987, Acorn launched the revolutionary Archimedes computer series, marking a watershed moment in personal computing history. The Archimedes was the world's first RISC-based home computer and the first commercial product to use the ARM processor.

#### The Launch Lineup
The initial Archimedes range included several models:
- **A305**: Entry-level model priced at £799
- **A310**: Mid-range desktop model with 1MB RAM
- **A410**: Higher-specification desktop
- **A440**: Top-of-the-range model

All models were still branded as part of the "BBC Microcomputer System," maintaining Acorn's educational heritage.

#### Technical Revolution
The Archimedes A310 and its siblings were powered by the ARM2 processor running at 8MHz - a remarkable achievement considering the ARM2 used only 27,000 transistors compared to contemporary processors that required hundreds of thousands. Key technical features included:

**Processor and Architecture:**
- ARM2 processor at 8MHz
- 32-bit architecture with exceptional performance
- Low power consumption
- Revolutionary RISC design

**Custom Support Chips:**
- **MEMC**: Memory management controller
- **VIDC**: Video and sound controller (could display 256 colors simultaneously)
- **IOC**: Input/output controller

**Graphics and Display:**
- Maximum resolution of 640×512 pixels
- Advanced color capabilities for the era
- Exceptional 3D graphics performance demonstrated by games like "Zarch"

**Operating System:**
- Initially ran "Arthur" operating system
- Later evolved into RISC OS, a sophisticated multitasking GUI

#### Performance Breakthrough
Contemporary reviews hailed the Archimedes as the "fastest microcomputer in the world." Personal Computer World noted that it felt "fastest... by a considerable margin" compared to competitors. This performance advantage came from ARM's elegant RISC design, which achieved superior performance with fewer transistors and lower power consumption than complex CISC processors.

#### Innovation in User Interface
The Archimedes featured groundbreaking user interface innovations, including the first implementation of a taskbar/dock concept - predating even NeXT's NextStep interface. This showed Acorn's forward-thinking approach to computer interaction.

#### Market Challenges
Despite its technical superiority, the Archimedes faced significant market challenges:
- **New Technology Barriers**: It introduced a new processor, new operating system, and had no existing software base
- **Software Development**: It took 2-3 years for a credible amount of native ARM applications to be developed
- **Limited Adoption**: Sold only a few hundred thousand units compared to millions of competitors like the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga
- **Price Point**: High cost limited mass market penetration

#### Educational Success
While struggling in the home market, the Archimedes found its niche in education, building on Acorn's strong relationship with UK schools established through the BBC Micro. The computer's advanced capabilities made it ideal for educational applications and computer science instruction.

#### Historical Significance
The Archimedes A310 and its siblings represented a pivotal moment in computing history:
- **First RISC Home Computer**: Proved that RISC architecture could work in consumer devices
- **ARM Foundation**: Established ARM as a viable processor architecture
- **Performance Milestone**: Demonstrated that low-power, simple designs could outperform complex processors
- **Future Vision**: Showed the potential for energy-efficient computing that would later dominate mobile devices

The Archimedes may not have achieved commercial success comparable to its technical achievements, but it laid the groundwork for ARM's eventual dominance in mobile computing, making it one of the most historically significant computers ever created.

## The Birth of ARM Holdings (1990-1998)
