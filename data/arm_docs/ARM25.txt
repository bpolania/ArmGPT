he story of ARM begins in the early 1980s, with technology that is now
iconic to a generation of engineers: the BBC Micro. This was an 8-bit home
computer, sponsored by the BBC and made by a Cambridge-based company
called Acorn Computers. The original design had been developed around
the 6502 microprocessor by among others Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber, and put
together quickly to win a prestigious contract for an educational program being run
by the BBC. Sophie and Steve had been friends at the Cambridge University Processor
Group, an English version of the Homebrew Club at Stanford University in California,
where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of Apple had first met. Sophie and Steve were
among the first to work for Acorn at their offices off the market square in the center
of Cambridge.
Following the success of the BBC Micro, Acorn was looking for a lower-cost
computer to expand the market. The next-generation system, the Electron, used a
similar architecture to the original BBC Micro but reduced the design from 102 chips to
just 12 by using a large uncommitted logic array, an early gate array technology, which
allowed a standard array of logic elements to be programmed in the factory with one
metal mask. This allowed a new chip to be designed and manufactured much faster
and more cheaply than a full custom design. Despite the simplicity, the Electron would
mark a dramatic change in the prospects for Acorn, and indirectly led to the creation
of ARM the company.
Soon, Acorn were looking for a new processor to replace the aging 6502. They
had been considering using Intel’s i286 processor, but Intel was not interested in
supplying Acorn with chips. So Steve and Sophie traveled the world looking at the
different options for a new processor, including a visit to hundreds of engineers in
Haifa who were designing the next processor for National Semiconductor’s NS16032,
and hundreds more in the US who were working on the 68020 for Motorola. But they
weren’t impressed with the options available, as they all required complex systems
which made them too expensive. In 1983 they visited the Western Design Center in LEFT The future arrived with the release of

ABOVE A flyer for the BBC Micro, the From a very early stage it was clear that to build the low-cost computer Acorn
computer used to design the first ARM needed to design not just a RISC processor but a complete system. The high-level
chip set. system architecture was developed and the system partitioned into four chips: the CPU,
a memory controller (MEMC) designed by Steve, a video processor (VIDC) designed by
Tudor, and an IO controller (IOC) designed by Mike. The original design envisioned four
68-pin packages, but it soon became clear that to achieve the performance required the
CPU would need 84 pins, and the system architecture was set.
Sophie finished the definition of the ARM1 instruction set in December 1983, and
handed it over to Steve. Through 1984 he developed the reference model for the
microarchitecture — how the instructions would be implemented — using models
written in the BASIC programming language and running on the BBC Micro. It was then
given to the VLSI team to implement the design and test it against the models.
The design of the processor was tested and completed, with the “tapeout” ready
in January 1985. The computer tape was delivered by hand to VLSI Technology’s
European headquarters in a very cold and snowy Munich. The full design used just
25,000 transistors and was built in a 3-micron process (where the smallest feature of
the transistor, the gate, measured 3 microns). This was a tiny fraction of, say, Motorola’s
32-bit 68020. Launched in 1984 and used in the Apple Macintosh and Lisa computers,
the Motorola chip had 250,000 transistors built in a 2-micron process.
The ARM1 began what came to be a key tradition for the engineers at ARM:

Among the changes made at Acorn in 1985, Robert Heaton moved to the US to take
up the role of director of engineering for US2, the US operation of the newly launched
European Silicon Structures (ES2). It was Europe’s answer to ASIC companies like VLSI
Technology and LSI Logic, and employed Robin Saxby as UK managing director. It
had been backed by $5 million from venture capital firm Advent and $60 million from
Olivetti, Saab, British Aerospace and Philips. So US2 was a significant venture, intended
to compete on equal terms with the US. But it used a different technology — instead of
a metal mask on top of a gate array, ES2 was using a technology developed in Europe
that used an electron beam to write the metal layer on top. This promised to be fast
and efficient, but ultimately proved to be much slower than the more traditional

In 1985 the US PC market was also suffering a downturn. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research
Center, where many computer innovations from windowed software to the mouse
were conceived, reduced its headcount. Hermann Hauser took advantage of this by
setting up the Acorn Palo Alto Research Lab in order to develop an operating system
for this exciting new chip architecture. He recruited Jim Mitchell to be director of
engineering, based in the US, with Steve Furber as the de facto manager of AR&D on
the ground in Cambridge.
The ARM2, delivered in 1987 on a 2-micron process by VLSI, coupled with MEMC,
VIDC and IOC, formed the heart of a new product line for Acorn: the Archimedes RISC
PC. At the same time a new approach to making chips was emerging. In 1984 Morris
Chang moved from being chief operating officer of chip giant Texas Instruments to
General Instrument. In that turbulent year of 1985 he was encouraged by the Taiwanese
government to look at how Taiwan could be a significant player in the emerging
electronics market, and left GI to become the president of the Industrial Technology
Research Institute in that country. His approach was to offer foundry services, taking
the tapes and producing the chips in volume, but not to undertake the design of
the chips themselves. Like the ARM business model, this allowed their customers
to innovate on top of a shared platform. This new “fabless” model was driven by the

RIGHT Acorn User was profiling the story of All of these factors convinced Chang and his commercial backer Philips to invest
Acorn computers, just as the end was in sight. in fabs in the Science Park at Hsinchu in 1987 and to create Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company — who would become a key partner of ARM.
Despite significant investment in the brand new object-oriented operating system
(ARX) written in Modular-2+, led by Jim and the team in Palo Alto, it became obvious
that it would never be ready in time for the planned launch — in June 1987 — of the
Archimedes RISC PC. For the time, the hardware was impressive, with an 8 MHz ARM2
microprocessor, color displays and integrated stereo audio. The basic model, the
Archimedes 310, came with 512 KB of memory and an integrated floppy drive for £799
retail. The top of the range A440 boasted 4 MB of memory and an integrated 20 MB
hard drive, at an eye-watering £2,299 for a home computer. And the operating system?
Well, that was developed in five months, and was initially launched as Arthur, later
renamed RISC OS. It was written mainly in assembly language and was hard coded into
512 KB of ROM, so no bugs were allowed.
As the Archimedes 300 and 400 began hitting the streets, the team turned its
attention to improved versions of the chip set, producing ARM3, MEMC1a and VIDC1a
and extending the architecture to ARMv2 by adding two SWAP instructions in an
attempt to improve the performance of ARX. The ARX project would continue for
another year or so until it became clear that it would never deliver, and the design
center was closed.
A move to a 1.5-micron process gave more space on ARM3, still using the ARMv2
architecture, enabling a 4KB cache memory to be added to further speed up the
performance. But all had not gone well at Acorn since Olivetti had taken overall
control. Hermann Hauser left the board of Acorn in 1988 to set up a new venture,
the Active Book Company. He planned to develop a portable computer, using a new
version of the ARM processor where the clock could be scaled right back to zero to
save power. This would be the fully static ARM2aS.
Malcolm Bird joined Acorn as director of engineering in November 1989 from PA
Consulting, also in Cambridge. Acorn had a reputation for being technically innovative,
Chang saw there was a new opportunity. Companies could design their own chips
and they didn’t need to have their own fabs. This significantly lowered the barriers
to entry for new companies, and it spurred a new wave of innovation, creating a
new breed of “fabless” chip companies. It also drove the emerging electronic design
automation (EDA) tools companies, and the development of high performance
computers, or workstations. In 1982, Sun Microsystems began building workstations,
and by 1985 was developing the SPARC processor that used the same RISC technique
as ARM. There was no shortage of companies looking to develop their own chips, and LEFT The ARM3 design team (l-r):

would use additional MEMC memory controllers. Although a single MEMC could only
handle 4 MB of memory it could be put together with three others to support 16 MB of
memory, which (for that time) was a massive achievement. This would also allow for a
more complex operating system, Arthur 2, to become the RISC OS.
The ARM chip set had been designed by Acorn for Acorn, with VLSI Technology
as a contract manufacturer. But Acorn had little experience of manufacturing chips
in volume, so in exchange for VLSI Technology providing resources and expertise
to develop the test infrastructure to bring the original chip set to volume, VLSI was
granted a license to sell the chips on the open market to its customers, and became
the first ARM licensee. This was the beginning of the ARM IP business model.
Ever since the crises of 1985, the idea to spin out the chip design group had
sporadically been explored at Acorn. There was even a file marked Newco (for new
company) in the desk Malcolm inherited from Jim Mitchell.
With the Olivetti connection, Malcolm approached French chip company Thomson-
CSF, which later merged with SGS to become STMicroelectronics. His proposals included
combining design teams or joint chip development, but they came to nothing. He also
talked to VLSI Technology, while they were making ARM chips, but it soon became clear
that the chief executive Al Stein wasn’t going to put in any money.
Meanwhile, Steve had decided to leave Acorn in order to take up the chair of
computer engineering at the university in his home city, Manchester. He took with him
a wealth of expertise on the ARM architecture that would be relevant for the next 20
years and more.
Apple had been evaluating the ARM development system as one of the options
for a revolutionary handheld computer it was developing in a separate, skunkworks
project (the Newton). But it had initially chosen a processor from AT&T called the
Hobbit, which had been developed at AT&T’s world-famous Bell Labs. While there had
been lots of razzamatazz around the launch of the Hobbit, the reality of delivering
working chips proved to be problematic. (In an ironic twist, Hermann’s Active Book
Company was bought by AT&T in July 1991 and merged with its EO subsidiary, and the processor was changed to the Hobbit. The EO Personal Communicator was launched ABOVE A 1990 trade advert for VLSI, ARM’s

chips, talking to Motorola, IBM, AMD and even Intel, as well as MIPS, about low-power
processors suitable for portable applications. Everyone was promising the world, of
course. If several people like what’s on the roadmap, the part gets made. If none do,
the roadmap changes and the company denies it ever intended to do anything like
that. In the end, “Everyone talked about their roadmaps, everyone had something
that would be ready next year, but it came down to Hobbit and ARM, and we went with
AT&T’s Hobbit,” as Larry explained. That was perhaps partly as a result of Acorn being
seen as a competitor to Apple in the education market.
When the Hobbit project ran into trouble, Apple needed an alternative. Malcolm
recalls that it was Hermann who talked to Larry Tesler, Apple’s vice president of
research and development at the time, on one of his networking visits to the Valley
on behalf of Active Book. “Basically,” he pointed out to Larry, “you’ve always been
interested in ARM, you’ve always been playing with it.” Larry said he couldn’t see it
going anywhere, and besides, it was owned by a competitor, which ruled it out for him.
That’s when they came up with the idea of the spinout. So Hermann called Malcolm,
saying, “This is the plan …”

n a cold November evening in 1990 the mist rolled across bleak fields and
curled itself around the country pub. It really was that kind of evening where
cars get lost and end up in ditches. And it really was a typical English country
pub, with a smoking real fire in the snug and smoky real ale at the bar. It was
not the kind of place usually associated with leading-edge technology.
Yet it was the setting for what would prove to be a momentous meeting for the
technology industry.
A Saab 9000 pulled up in the car park and two men stepped out. One of them, Robin
Saxby, was at a major crossroads in his career, and was hoping the meeting would point
him in the right direction. He had been offered a new job, running a startup based in
Cambridge, but he needed to know whether it was a sensible move, and for that he
needed to meet the team of engineers he would be leading. If he didn’t get on with them,
or they really didn’t like him, then the whole deal was doomed. The other man was Brian
O’Donnell, the director of engineering at European Silicon Structures, both men’s current
employer, and the cheese to Saxby’s chalk: quiet, pensive and careful with his words.
In the summer a headhunter had called Robin about the job. It involved working with
people who had been spun out of Acorn, a company Robin didn’t have much time for, but
the new venture also promised the involvement of Apple, which was intriguing.
European Silicon Structures had been the biggest chip startup in Europe in years, but
ES2 (as it was known) was struggling. It had expanded into the US, where Saxby had been
working. But the recession in the electronics industry at the end of the 1980s meant job
cuts and contraction. This was happening to all the big companies — including IBM, VLSI
Technology, LSI Logic.
This meeting at the Rose and Crown pub in Ashwell offered him a chance to run
what was a potentially world-beating company. This was a very rare opportunity for a
UK startup at the end of the 1980s, but it was far from being a sure thing. His experience
with the global semiconductor market could be vital to the new company. He had seen

adventure? Some of the team were not happy with the sudden request, and their responses to
it were symptomatic of the resistance Malcolm had been facing from various quarters
within AR&D. “Lee wasn’t happy with the short notice, but Jamie said he could go, and so
we all went down in my car,” added Tudor. “We met with Robin, and after an hour Larry
went for his plane.”
Tudor and Jamie knew when they met him that they could deal with him, and started
to work out how the new company would operate. “Jamie and I had a chat with Robin
and then Jamie went off to the loo,” Tudor recalls, continuing “and Robin asked me if
everyone would be happy reporting to Jamie and I said no, I felt it had to be a flatter

he was serious or not, although now I don’t think he was; it was a point of principle. The
funny thing is that he’s not hard at all, he’s as soft as a pussycat in some respects.”
John had worked at Acorn during his summer break, but when he graduated
in 1985, the place he had been promised disappeared in one of the company’s
regular purges. So he had gone to work for another high technology company, Cray
Computers, which was making supercomputers. But the people in Acorn proved
honorable, and when a place opened up again, he was offered it.
John was the one who had suggested the pub as a meeting place, a decision that
went down well with Saxby, who was used to doing business in pubs — many of the
interviews with potential staff for the fledgling ARM took place in such places. In the
US, deals tend to be done in restaurants such as Il Fornaio, a swish Italian in downtown
San Jose, just across from the Convention Center.

partnerships and targeting the embedded market. While companies such as Intel and
IBM were the world’s dominant providers of processors, Robin recognized that the time
for starting such companies had passed. The history of the electronics industry is littered
with the skeletons of companies that thought they could do the same thing as Intel
or IBM. Instead Robin took ARM down the road of supplying the technology to these
companies, large and small, all around the world. It was not just making workstations for
high performance computers, but anything else that needed a microprocessor.
That was a huge challenge for a small company in Cambridge with just 12 engineers
and one boss, with no salespeople or sales offices anywhere. It required a supreme
and renamed the Gx. What they wanted to do was design the best processors in the
world, not mess about with managing people. They knew that Acorn could no longer
afford its own chip design team, but wanted its own chips designed, and that Apple
desperately needed a replacement for Hobbit that wouldn’t cost them a fortune. As
far as the team was concerned, while there was no guarantee that Robin would take
the job — as Tudor explained, “I told Malcolm, ‘Yes, he’s great but you’ll never get him,
he won’t want to move to Cambridge’” — they could carry on as they were. Malcolm
had drawn up a business plan that saw the group continue with consultancy, selling the
idea of the processor to people and then customizing it for different applications and
ASIC suppliers. That would allow the team to keep doing what it did best, design chips.
As Tudor says, “Robin’s issue was ‘What’s your vision?’ and we didn’t have one. We’d
basically spent ten years building brilliant technology that went nowhere and we had
no vision, which was sad.”
Eventually, the meeting in the pub went well. Brian O’Donnell quizzed the team
and gave them the thumbs up. Robin asked the team whether they’d agree to spend

was nothing in the barn, but it had just been renovated and the owner, David Rayner
(owner of Scotsdales, the largest garden center in Cambridge), was anxious to have it
rented out, so there was a deal to be made.
Robin set about acquiring furniture from all sorts of places. It’s claimed that he won
a table for the boardroom on the flip of a coin, but similarly lost a set of desk drawers,
leaving one of the engineer’s desks without desk storage for several months. This
certainly wasn’t a swish startup with a swanky office and cash to burn, but a small group
of UK engineers looking to compete with well-funded teams of hundreds of designers
all around the world.
So on a spring day in March 1991, Lee Smith entered the barn on a Friday with
equipment from the office in Acorn, and set it up so that work could start on the Monday.
The team got straight on with redesigning the new chip. The 26-bit address width
was a problem for Apple, who wanted a full 32-bit address in order to build more complex
systems. So the entire core had to be redesigned. Enter the ARM6: the macrocell,
designed for the VLSI Technology process. The ARM60 was the ARM6 processor core
with a simple pad ring so it could be packaged as a stand-alone processor. Work was also
underway on a hardware floating point unit and an enhanced video chip, VIDC2, which
had to be designed for Acorn for use in scientific workstations. However, they took up
significant resources in development and testing.
The ARM6xx family were chips that added cache memory and a full virtual memory
translation system to the ARM6 core. The ARM610 was the chip that would power both
Apple’s Newton MessagePad and the next generation of Acorn’s Archimedes RISC PC.
But while the engineers were working on the chip design, Robin had other problems.
He needed cash, customers and more staff. Moreover he needed a story to sell — and
asking the engineers for the SWOT analysis was part of it. These are normally the job of
the sales people, but the engineers had the best sense of the company’s strengths, and
were intellectually honest enough to know its shortcomings.

and low power of 120 mW. But ARM had competing requirements from partners. Acorn
wanted a powerful, low-cost desktop processor, while Apple wanted a powerful, low
power processor. Robin had seen the competition in the desktop market and wanted to
head toward embedded designs that were only just emerging.
But at the time everything was about the speed of the processor — how fast you
could execute instructions. This was even more important for a RISC system, as you did
simple things very fast, so MIPS and IBM were pushing ever-higher speeds. And that
was what mattered to Acorn as a desktop system. The lower power simply allowed the
cheaper packaging that kept the cost down.

Another problem identified early on was software. ARM processors only ran the
RISC OS operating system developed by Acorn, but not much else. And there weren’t
that many applications for RISC OS. This suffered in comparison to the range of
applications available on Microsoft’s Windows, whose latest version, Windows 3.0,
launched in August 1990.
ARM still had to identify their target customers. It was one of the key problems for
a new company. ARM sold to a chipmaker, who sold to an equipment maker. Robin’s
job included getting this way of doing business turned around, in order to have an end
equipment maker specify an ARM processor core — then several of his customers
could bid for the design, and if they wanted to be a part of that design, they had to
come to ARM to buy a core. That push-pull approach to the market has always served
ARM well.
All of this came together in one theme, the global RISC standard. It became the
rallying cry for the company and for customers. It kept Apple and Acorn engaged and
flattered their positions as technology leaders, while allowing ARM to go for those
other emerging markets where the small size, low cost and low power of their designs
would also appeal.
GEC Plessey Semiconductors was an obvious choice as an early customer. Plessey
had been in the electronics industry in the UK since the 1960s, and had built some of
the first chip fabs in Europe and had provided ULAs, a forerunner to FPGAs used in the
design of the original BBC Micro. In 1990 it had been subject to a bruising takeover

smartcards. TI has had a long relationship with ARM, with John Scarisbrick, the former
head of Europe for TI, joining the board in August 2001. TI was notorious for having a
dominant legal department and dictating terms to partners, particularly limiting any
announcements about a deal. ARM managed not only to negotiate a successful deal DATE 1995
with them, but they included a clause, as with other partners, that allowed them to talk TECHNOLOGY VLSI “CMN6” 0.6 µm (3-layer metal)

company. When Samsung signed up in 1994, no one paid much notice — the deal with DESCRIPTION First 16-bit instruction ARM processor
AKM (Asahi Kasei Microdevices) in the same year was seen as being more significant —
but it was to lead to greater things than even the TI deal.
By 1994 ARM had grown to some 40 people, mostly engineers, with a smattering of
support staff, and the barn was bursting at the seams. A row of 18 champagne bottles
lined its staircase.
While ARM’s prospects were growing, Acorn’s were in a terminal decline, and it had
lost enough staff by March 1994 that when Acorn moved to smaller premises, ARM
could move back to the Water Pumping Station at Cherry Hinton. In some instances
employees returned to the same desks they had vacated three years earlier, which might
have seemed a small step forward, or even half a step back. But in reality ARM was very
much in the ascendency. It wouldn’t be long before ARM chips were world-renowned
and dominating their industry, helping to power so much invention and revolution in
consumer technology around the globe. Less than five years after they’d launched, ARM
had struggled and overcome many problems and emerged from its initial phase almost
whole. Tragically, though, there had been a huge loss to the team when Al Thomas, the
bright star Steve Furber had seen as the next ARM architect, took his own life. His loss hit
everyone hard. It was a huge shock, and one that has never been forgotten by everyone
at the company — which is why this book is dedicated to him.

ven when you’ve come so far, what do you do next to invent your own future?
By 1994 it was clear that the first showcase products — the Apple Newton
MessagePad and the 3DO Multiplayer — had not fared well. The handwriting
recognition on the MessagePad was less than impressive, and while the 3DO
player had sold 2 million units, that wasn’t enough to sustain production. Although
Sharp was a partner with Nintendo, the use of an ARM core in the Game Boy had not
yet been agreed. However, just after the move back to the original Acorn campus on
Fulbourn Road, an unassuming, highly talented engineer called Warren East had been
recruited to ARM from Texas Instruments’ UK site in Bedford, with a brief to manage
the partnership with Sharp on the Nintendo project.
Part of the struggle for 3DO had been its business model, elements of which
it shared with ARM. 3DO designed the hardware and licensed it to a range of
manufacturers. It also wrote some games, and took a royalty fee from other games
companies. Neither, though, was generating enough to invest in the next-generation
system (called the M2, and using a PowerPC chip from Motorola rather than an ARM-
based chip).
ARM risked being in the same position, without enough licensees to generate
sufficient royalties to survive. Like 3DO, ARM was also not in control of which products
would succeed and which would not — that was down to the commercial decisions of
the partners. Both the Newton and 3DO Multiplayer proved that even great low-power
technology wasn’t enough to create compelling and successful consumer products.
Even worse, there was a long gap — potentially several years — from the licensing
of products to the royalties kicking in. So ARM needed more profile to bring in more
licenses to increase the potential for successful, high-volume royalty-generating

implementations for an upfront license fee, with a royalty payable on each chip shipped
using the core. Companies such as Samsung paid a higher upfront license fee (which
really helped the cash flow in 1994) in return for paying a lower royalty rate later on.
The third way was to also license out the architecture itself for engineers to build
their own implementations. This helped the few companies who prided themselves on
designing their own microprocessors to overcome their Not Invented Here syndrome.
To a certain extent, that didn’t make any sense, because the point of ARM’s business
model was that its customers could employ fewer chip designers, not more. ARM
took the effort out of designing a large portion of the chip, allowing them to focus on
adding value to their product. However, for these partners, owning the design meant
they had more control over their product. As it turned out, the change was to prove a
key move, and contributed to ARM earning royalties far into the future.
By 1994, the American computer manufacturer Digital Equipment Corporation was
playing catch up with the rest of the industry. It lived in the world of big computers, not
the PC. Back in 1977 its founder, Ken Olsen, had notoriously questioned the rationale
for the home computer, going as far as to say that “There is no reason anyone would
want a computer in their home.” However, DEC’s VAX and PDP-11 mini-computers had
become the mainstay of many corporate operations. It had developed a new, 64-bit
RISC architecture, called Alpha, to replace the 32-bit VAX architecture. The first Alpha
workstations and servers were launched in 1994; at the Hot Chips conference in Silicon
Valley the same year DEC showed the 21164 Alpha chip.
At the same time, ARM was trying to get some good publicity in Microprocessor
Report, the industry newsletter (who organized the Microprocessor Forum conference
of 1992 that led to ARM’s tie-up with TI), that had launched in Silicon Valley in 1987
and which was the bible of high-end processor design and champion of RISC designs.
Founder and main writer Michael Slater had reviewed ARM’s plans and told them, “I
think you’ve got something pretty good but you need high-end cover, even though
it’s not your main business.” ARM decided that was a good idea, and called a board
meeting to talk about who to partner with. There was another very important clause in the deal. “We were worried about what ABOVE The original product brochure for

particular. It wasn’t performance or clock rate, it was the size of the code that ran on it.
Back in 1994, Tim O’Donnell had approached Larry for technical advice. He was
struggling with potential customers who were used to 8-bit and 16-bit code, where the
size of the code was a lot smaller. This meant smaller memories and lower system cost.
Surely, he thought, since Sophie’s original ARM instruction set used a 26-bit program
counter to handle the addresses rather than a 32-bit address bus, it couldn’t be too hard.
Larry suggested putting a general-purpose emulator into the ARM chip to emulate 8-
or 16-bit code, so Tim ran that by Mike Muller, who called it “a terrible idea.” Larry said,
“come up with a better one,” and every time O’Donnell raised it with the engineers

Nokia were looking for a new line of digital mobile phones with a more
sophisticated display, and it needed a high performance, low power general-purpose
processor that could be integrated with other components such as the DSP. A British
project manager at Nokia had picked up the latest issue of Acorn User magazine at an
airport in which a feature had highlighted the ARM core used in the Archimedes PC. So
they looked at the ARM7DI, but the 32-bit code, while more compact than other 32-bit
architectures, wasn’t as good as the existing 16-bit implementation they were using
from Hitachi.
Following a depressing trip back from Finland after failing to convince Nokia
to move to the ARM7DI, Dave Jaggar, the New Zealand engineer with an intimate
knowledge of the instructions as part of the ARMulator development, sketched out a
way to encode a set of 32-bit instructions using only 16 bits. The key was that it used
an extra block of transistors at the start of the process, so that code didn’t need to be
rewritten. In a nod to the increasing use of ARM as a word rather than an acronym, this
became known as Thumb. The team returned to Finland, and convinced Nokia and TI
to take a gamble that ARM could add Thumb to the ARM7TD and deliver ARM7TDMI on
an aggressive schedule, in order to meet their projected new product launch.
Thumb turned out to be vital to the success of the development of the next
generation of digital mobile phone chips. In March 1995, it was announced to the
world, targeting “mobile phones, pagers and disk controllers [that] require more
performance, address space and software support than 8- or 16-bit controllers can
deliver.” ARM’s PR blurb attacked its own products, saying “while 32-bit systems are fast
enough, they may be too expensive for consumer markets, since they require more
memory and a more complex circuit board.”
Thumb reduced the typical program size by 30-40 percent from ARM’s already
good code density, which was great for designers where memory was tight.
The press release that announced the launch of Thumb took pains to point out The industry’s knowledge of Nokia’s adoption of Thumb for future products helped ABOVE Original product information for the

sensor After conducting what is commonly called a “beauty parade” of merchant banks
for the job of conducting their flotation, the ARM board selected US bank Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, which dominated the technology landscape at the time. Being a
UK company with a global business proved something of a challenge for the financial
markets. American investors — including Apple — wanted the shares to be available
on the Nasdaq stock exchange, or, failing that, the New York Stock Exchange. Which
was where companies such as Intel, AMD, Dell, HP, Cisco and WorldCom were hosted.
But Nasdaq did not admit foreign companies at the time of the ARM float, and there
was no appetite to move ARM to America. (Nasdaq allowed listings of non-US-based
companies from January 1998, but only under stricter criteria than US companies.) So
the London Stock Exchange was the natural choice. Robin wanted to make sure that the
focus was global, though, so the company restructured as ARM Holdings. This allowed
a dual listing, issuing shares in London as well as using American Depository Shares on
Nasdaq. This type of US listing allowed for US dollar-denominated equity shares (each of

share holding in ARM. This reverse takeover would have been tax efficient for the Acorn
shareholders, but would have left the ARM management with the challenge of disposing
of the failing Acorn business. In an aggressive move — which left some of the founders
with deep reservations about future joint ventures — the ARM management were all
served with legal notices reminding them of their fiduciary duty to their shareholders in
considering any course of action, and the possible ramifications should they not do this.
The team duly considered the best course of action for all the shareholders, and, with
the support of Apple and VLSI Technology, put the IPO back on track.
The dual listing almost killed the IPO, too. When Robin arrived in New York for the
launch on Nasdaq he was told that ARM’s employee share options were legal for London
but they contravened the Nasdaq regulations. So more money had to be put aside to
allow for them, but once that was confirmed, the flotation was back on.
On April 17, 1998, ARM Holdings floated 11 million shares on the London Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq at £5.75 each in London and $29 in the US. The IPO valued ARM at
£264 million, raising £33 million for existing shareholders Acorn, Apple and VLSI, plus the
founders. The shares rocketed in value, even though the launch price of $29 was already
well ahead of market expectations of $19. The price rose to over $42 that day, giving a
huge vote of confidence in the technology, the intellectual property (IP) model, and the
foundry business.
The very same day saw another tech star float on Nasdaq. Broadcom had been
started in 1991, by Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas, in an apartment in southern
California (not Silicon Valley). They had also seen the opportunity offered by the
foundry model, and were designing demodulator chips for TV set-top boxes. They
then turned to Fast Ethernet chips and were a key part of the growth of connecting
devices for Internet access. Theirs was a more traditional chip startup, with backing
from venture capital as well as investment by customers such as Intel, Cisco and General
Instrument. Merchant bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter underwrote the flotation, as it
did with ARM. Broadcom floated at $24, with shares changing hands for over $60 later in
the day, and was called the hottest deal of the year.
The two flotations were a part of the Internet bubble, a period later defined as
“irrational exuberance” by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Typically massive valuations of Internet stocks such as boohoo.com, broadcast.com
and Geocities.com overshadowed the growth of companies building the information
infrastructure, such as Cisco and WorldCom.

Naturally, some people had missed out on the success of the IPO. The company had
grown from employing 30 people to over 350 in just four years, but a few had left, giving
up their share options when they did so. When some of them returned later they had to
face being teased by Robin about the cash and options they missed out on. But there
were also those who had been at the company from the beginning, and who had always
believed in what they were capable of. They quietly and calmly got on with the business
of doing what they loved most.
While the IPO marked a turning point for the future of ARM, essentially giving it
more funds for growth, the business of processor design continued as relentlessly as it
always had.

Patents another 18 months to emerge from Lucent Technologies.
Powered by the supercharged share price, ARM’s first full acquisition of another

company was of Micrologic, a software house in Cambridge. The deal, led by vice
president for operations Warren East, was for just £1.1 million. For comparison, during
1999 Broadcom bought five companies for a total of nearly $1 billion.
The same year, ARM’s share price continued to grow, and it entered the FTSE100.
Fourteen partners, including global names such as Qualcomm, IBM and Philips, had
joined the partnership, which was now shipping over 50 million units per year. Coming
full circle, Acorn ceased to trade and its holding in ARM shares was distributed to its
shareholders. Acorn’s set-top box business was sold off to Pace in Yorkshire; while the
rump of the digital signal processing business, including chief architect Sophie Wilson,
was sold to the managing director Stan Boland. This became Element 14
(after the chemical symbol for Silicon), and was sold to Broadcom the following
year for $640 million. The rest of the value of Acorn was returned to shareholders
as ARM shares. ABOVE ARM CEO Robin Saxby launched a

space on the board, filled by Doug Dunn. GEC Plessey Semiconductors had been sold
to Canadian chip designer Mitel Semiconductor in 1998, while in 1999 GEC bought
networking companies Reltec and Fore Systems, renaming itself Marconi to cash in (it
hoped) on the growing Internet bubble.
The last year of the 20th century saw the launch of a synthesizable version of the
ARM9, which opened up more opportunities; the family would be a workhorse even
more popular than the ARM7. It would be designed into chips for the Nintendo DS,
84 Atheros Wi-Fi and TI’s OMAP1. Eventually it would sell to over 250 licensees, including
more than 100 licenses for the synthesizable ARM926EJ-S alone.
The semiconductor world had changed considerably in the years since ARM was
launched. 172 million processors had been shipped by its partners by the end of the
decade, and it employed over 400 staff in offices around the world, from Tokyo to
Austin. The Cambridge campus was being expanded, and by November 1999 a whole
new main building was ready for occupation on the Fulbourn Road site. Not that
anyone was willing to move into it at the time — like the rest of the world, ARM held its
breath waiting for the new millennium and the much-vaunted Year 2000 apocalypse.

he turn of the millennium was a disappointment for those expecting global
Armageddon and the collapse of the world’s technical infrastructure.
Everybody was afraid that the Year 2000 (Y2K) “bug” was going to crash
computer-controlled systems (in which the date was stored as only two
decimal points) and bring chaos … It didn’t, of course. Not that anyone was taking any
chances, especially at ARM where they discovered early in 1999 that only 30 percent
of their systems were Y2K compliant. If the workstations and servers went down the
company couldn’t operate. So, despite their brand new building — ARM1 — being
completed by the end of 1999 and it being as secure, up-to-date and as Y2K compliant
as possible, they waited until after the turn of the year to move in — just in case. The
1998 share flotation and the coming of the millennium had, naturally, caused some
people at ARM to re-evaluate their priorities. After the acquisition of three companies,
the workforce comprised almost 700 people in offices around the world, and along
with the growth came changes in the culture of the business.
It was a time of reflection for many people, and that bright ARM star Dave Jaggar,
for one, decided to change his life radically. He cashed in his shares at what turned out
to be the peak of the market, and returned to New Zealand. He continued to consult
for ARM, but naturally became less involved in the business of day-to-day product
development.
The company was flying, though. During the first year of the 21st century, ARM
signed up eight new licensees, including field programmable chip designer Altera,
who put ARM cores alongside its programmable fabric for their Excalibur family. In
November 2000, just after the deal went through, John Daane took over as CEO at
Altera, joining from LSI Logic. Other licensees included test equipment maker Agilent,
German chip designer Micronas, Japanese chip giant Mitsubishi — which dominated
the 4-bit and 8-bit microcontroller sector — plus Sanyo, Triscend and ZTEIC.

became members of the ARM Foundry Program, which allowed them to sell cores to
their customers, avoiding the need for a large upfront license fee but still providing the
royalties. ARM became secure enough to look to the expansion and growth of the ARM
architecture, not just the cash flow.
The following year would turn out to be momentous in many ways, with ARM’s
management changes, and drama in the wider world too, as the Internet bubble burst,
share prices collapsed and global uncertainty increased. But ARM’s share of the 32-bit
embedded RISC microprocessor market was at 76.8 percent, which was a vindication
of the strategy to become the global RISC standard. It had seen off PowerPC, SPARC
and the other architectures on its way to lead in mobile phones, portable music
systems, disk drive controllers and many other areas. It hadn’t really made it on to the
desktop, though, despite Intel’s Xscale chip developments and Microsoft’s PocketPC
software. Nor had it made much of a dent in 4-bit and 8-bit controllers in washing
machines and other home appliances. The ARM9EJ-S was an immediate success,
with several companies adopting it for their chip designs. ARM made further small
business deals, including the acquisition in February 2001 of key technologies and a
10-person embedded debug design team from Noral Micrologics in Blackburn, in the
UK northwest.

Yet Robin’s entrepreneurial “just do it” approach did not necessarily sit well with
the merchant banks and the City of London traders in the shares of publicly listed
companies. Sales of ARM licenses were slowing as customers became less certain
about the future; the growth of royalties began to slow, too. At listed companies
suffering such apparent slowdowns in growth the chief executive is usually replaced.
The big question at ARM was: Who would replace Robin? The options were almost
the same as back in 1991: Jamie, Mike and Tudor, for instance. But none of them had
wanted it back then, plus they didn’t have the experience of running a £100 million
company with 700 employees. Of course, Jamie’s previous role had been chief
operating officer; his replacement, Warren, had also negotiated several recent
acquisitions and thus become visible to the market; Simon Segars, meanwhile, was
still gaining experience. Having an orderly transition was important, not least because
when founders hand over, all too often unforeseen repercussions can result.
Then came the terrible events of September 11, 2001. The consequences of the
attack on the World Trade Center in New York hit the US and global markets hard.
When all flights to and from the US and many other major cities were grounded for
several days, the world’s traveling businesspeople were stranded in hotel rooms,
working with laptop computers and telephones, watching in horror as the full extent
of the catastrophic terrorist attack hit home. That tragic day played a significant part in
tipping the global economy into the recession that had been approaching.
Nonetheless, in October 2001, Robin handed over to Warren and took on the role
of executive chairman. Warren continued with the chief operating officer role for the
day-to-day running of the company, while Robin stepped back. Mike Muller came on
to the board as chief technology officer, Tudor took over as chief operating officer, and
Jamie left the board. At the same time Tim O’Donnell stepped down as head of the US
operation, to be replaced by Reynette Au. She had worked at AMD, Hobbit-designer
AT&T Microelectronics and IBM; she was a highly experienced executive. Meanwhile,
the company launched ARMv6 and the next generation of cores. ARMv6 added SIMD to people at ARM that they needed to keep their rapidly growing family of licensees ABOVE Two of the four Facebook founders

another patent case, this time brought against the company by Nazomi over the

ARM’s biggest acquisition deal happened in 2004, with the purchase of Artisan
Components for $1 billion. It was an event that would both transform the company with
a further shift away from Cambridge and bring continued scrutiny from the financial
markets. The move was driven by a desire to go beyond the traditional business
of licensing processor cores, and the ever-increasing importance of the quality of
implementation of its architectures in meeting the needs of markets as diverse as low-
cost sensors to high performance servers.
The acquisition followed the launch of a whole new architecture and naming
scheme that marked a further departure from the original instruction set developed
by Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber. The Cortex branding moved away from the ARM1
to ARM11 numbering system, and instead created three different families of cores with
applications processors named Cortex-A, real-time Cortex-R and microcontrollers
Cortex-M. The architecture was also re-designed to reflect the naming, with distinct
profiles for each of the classes of processors. Support for the original 26-bit address
was lost in ARMv4, but the biggest change was in the ARMv7-M profile, which further

In 2005, Simon Segars joined the board of ARM. At the time, WiMax was a hot topic,
with Sequans collaborating with ARM on a reference design for the wireless local loop
technology on what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt by Intel to undermine the
strength of the cellular business. The drive at ARM on design tools continued, and a
competitor — Keil Software — was added to the company. It gave ARM a set of tools
for software developers which also supported other architectures, while ensuring that
the latest ARM technology was always included. This became increasingly important
with the launch of the first of the Cortex-A processors. The Cortex-A8 was the first
high performance applications processor to really tap into the high-speed design
techniques used by StrongARM to get to 1 GHz through its ARMv7-A architecture. It
would be used by Qualcomm and Apple, but at this point, TI was the lead partner for its
OMAP smartphone chips, with the core combining the Thumb-2 instructions set with
NEON, Jazelle and TrustZone technologies.
“TI has been one of ARM’s lead partners for more than 12 years, and during this
time we have shipped an impressive 1.7 billion ARM processor-based chips,” said Gilles
Delfassy, TI’s senior vice president of its Wireless Terminals Business Unit. “TI built the

At the other end of the scale, the DesignStart Program brought together all the
processor core, interconnect and peripheral technologies from ARM, and combined
them with the physical technologies from Artisan so that companies could easily
use them at a wide range of foundries. This was a compelling step forward, replacing
the need for different technologies from different providers for separate foundries.
Instead, DesignStart made it easier for both the chip designers and the foundries to
get the chips made.
The Artisan acquisition brought more US interest in ARM, and alongside companies
such as Intel, TI and Sony, it was recognized at the end of 2005 by US publication
Electronic Business as one of the 10 most significant companies in electronics over the

Growth had returned to ARM, which now had some 1300 staff around the world.

no longer supported the 32-bit instructions in Thumb-2 to get smaller size, smaller
code size and low power to replace the 8-bit and 16-bit devices. With 15 licensees in the
first nine months of the year, the Cortex-M0 would prove to be the fastest-growing
processor in the company’s history. But the global recession resulting from the banking
crisis continued to shake markets, undermine governments and throw currencies into
a downward spiral. Although revenue dropped by 10 percent to £489 million, ARM
remained confident that it could still take market share and grow the number of units
shipped. It took encouragement in that belief from market research firm Semico,
which finished the year with the prediction that by 2011 ARM would be the biggest
microcontroller architecture, beating x86 and PowerPC.
World domination had been established — in the nicest possible way, of course.
RIGHT How the Mali chip evolved, as drawn video cameras and the Nintendo DS handheld gaming device, as well as in Toshiba HD
by an engineer who knows … digital televisions, Samsung and Seagate hard disk drives, Bosch automotive braking
systems, HP printers, and wireless routers from Linksys and Netgear. All the handsets
for China’s 3G cellular trials were ARM-based, and the Mali-200 graphics processor unit
became fully integrated with the ARM cores thanks to the acquisition of Falanx. Apple’s
$278 million purchase of PA Semiconductor brought it the StrongARM team there.
Although the buyout sparked rumors of an Apple move to the PowerPC, in fact the
StrongARM experience came to good use on Apple’s own ARM chips that would later
be used in the iPad.
As the global financial meltdown gathered pace, ARM held a total of 587 licenses.
Remarkably, they were still shipping the ARM7TDMI to new customers. The ARM926
was the best-selling core, but the ARM11 was catching up fast. The Cortex-A8 and
Cortex-A9 were taking off with the smartphone makers, while the Cortex-M3 was
slowly gaining traction as a microcontroller. The company continued to be flexible
with business models, and the ARM IP Portfolio Program provided access to a
comprehensive range of ARMIP quickly, via a design house. Socle Technology in Taiwan
was the first to enroll, licensing the ARM11 family. Mali-200 and Mali-55 graphics cores,
CoreSight (the new name for AMBA) and PrimeCell peripherals were adapted so that
companies who were not chip specialists could still use ARM technology. Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing, one of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company’s competitors, was a major shareholder in Socle, and sought to provide a
“one-stop shop” solution in the latest manufacturing technology.
In 2009 a 2 GHz-capable Cortex-A9 dual core processor was implemented, and a
Swedish video technology developer, Logipard, was acquired. But it was the Cortex-M0
that made the greatest impact. The Cortex-M0 broke the link with the 32-bit past. It

n November 2010 every ARM colleague worldwide arrived at work and was given
the future. Their future, ARM’s future — everyone’s future, even. It was right there
in front of them, carefully and securely wrapped in a box the size of a large book (a
bit like this one).
This gift of the future didn’t make it into ARM’s 2010 annual report. It was a gift
from ARM itself, a celebration of its 20th anniversary — a significant milestone in the
company’s development. After a hard couple of years, ARM had finally and definitively
emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-2009. As Ian Thornton, head of investor
relations, put it, “Revenues took a bit of a curtsey, but we were nowhere near as
affected as other companies.”
On February 8, 2010, ARM had joined the UK’s FTSE100, replacing chocolate-maker
Cadbury. When first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998, ARM’s revenues were
£42.3 million and its profits £9.4 million. In 2010 its revenues would be almost ten times
greater, at £406.6 million, and its profits increased seventeen-fold, to £164.3 million. By
2014, revenues would have almost doubled again, to £795.2 million, and profits more
than doubled, to £400.3 million. Between 2010 and 2015, ARM would outperform the
FTSE100 by 382 percent, excluding dividends.
That outperformance was driven, in good part, by the future as represented by the
contents of that package on every ARM employee’s desk: a first-generation iPad, safe
in its own special custom case. At that moment, an iPad was, pretty much, the most
exciting piece of tech even an ARM team member could wish to have. It was so new
that there were not just countries but whole swathes of the world where it wouldn’t be
available for months.
In logistical terms, just getting them to people was quite something. The idea,
the ordering and preparing, the whole process, everything had been done in almost
complete secrecy. Only office managers knew it was coming. The packages had been
delivered to ARM’s offices worldwide. (Well, everyone except the team in the Taiwan
office, where they got stuck in customs.)
The gift’s significance, however, stretched way beyond excellent logistics. As well
as bringing the future to the — actual, physical — hands of everyone at ARM, it also

The iPad had only been announced in early 2010, on January 27, by Steve Jobs,
at a press conference in San Francisco. “A magical and revolutionary device at an
unbelievable price,” he said of Apple’s latest innovation — 27 years after he first
outlined a future that would arrive for everyone at ARM. In a 1983 speech at the
International Design Conference in Aspen, the theme of which was “The Future Isn’t
What It Used To Be,” the Apple CEO had shared his dream of “an incredibly great
computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20
minutes … with a radio link … to hook up to … databases and other computers.” Whch,

to imagine Apple using anything other than an ARM-based processor in there.”
In 2010, ARM was fulfilling its own predictions of its future. In 1999, a year
after its secondary listing on Nasdaq, the company published a forward-looking
review. It considered, carefully, ARM’s place in the next generation of digital
electronic applications, seeing the company’s opportunity in the sweet spot where
communications and consumer electronics would converge. “This is our chosen area;
this is where we are focused, and it is the area where we believe our future will be big.
Really big,” read the review. It dreamed of “entirely new and potentially huge markets”
out there waiting to be brought to life on mobile devices. “Imagine arriving in a strange

MP4 GPU. which was a 56 percent increase on the previous year’s total, more than 150 percent
more than five years earlier and many million times more than in the first year ARM
chips were shipped, in 1991. Between 2006 and 2010 ARM had more than doubled its
share of both the hard disk drive and digital TV markets. Its market penetration of the
microcontroller market increased tenfold. These chips, which are used in consumer
products from washing machines to toys, are the ones at the base of the price pyramid
— less than a dollar each. They have to be as cheap as, well, chips. But, of course, they
still need to be smart.
As of 2010, more and more ARM chips were making their way into mobile phones.
This was essentially a result of mobiles getting smarter. While a basic mobile would
have just one chip, a typical smartphone would generally use three or four of them.
These chips were also more expensive — and so generated higher revenue per phone.
There were more of these chips, too. Mobile phone sales were increasing by an overall
annual 20 percent — while that figure was 55 percent for smartphones. In 2009 the
average number of ARM-based chips in a phone rose from 2.1 to 2.5. In its annual report
for 2010 ARM predicted that, in the medium term, “we believe that we can grow our
revenues at about twice the rate of our costs.” And fourth-generation mobile phone
networks were still only on their way around the world. Though introduced in South
Korea as early as 2006, commercial 4G took time to become universal.
With hindsight it is clear that 2010 was a year in which boundaries between
technologies began to slip. A new kind of mobile computing was emerging, of which
the iPad was a harbinger. In ARM’s own words, as stated in the year-end report,

and very often don’t tell ARM what they do, either. Security is paramount, of course,
and any clues as to a bank’s IP could lead to the possible breaking into of that bank’s
accounts.
Academic Dr. James F. Moore was tasked by ARM with writing a 2012 assessment of
its IP strategy. He reported that “multiple members of the ARM team” told him that the
company deliberately and consciously “leaves room for others to differentiate on the
chip.” This “connecting the dots,” as one ARM person put it, is critical to the company’s
business model. This broad base of partners and markets means that ARM is not overly
reliant on any single company or consumer product for its future profits and cash.
It’s a model that requires commitment and trust. ARM is part of partner
companies’ R&D teams, so there needs to be openness and honesty at the heart of
the trading relationship, reinforced with trust, so that future plans are not jeopardized.
Semiconductor companies may not get told as much by OEMs as ARM does, and ARM
cannot — and does not — tell others about the depth and level of knowledge that has
been revealed in the due course of doing its work.
ARM’s own estimate is that it would cost each and every individual semiconductor
company $100 million to do what ARM effectively does for them — a potential

$20 billion cost burden that ARM saves the industry. As for ARM, those R&D costs are
— ideally — recouped in revenues from licenses. The income from royalties is profit. In
2010, royalty revenues rose by 36 percent.

FREQUENCY 266 MHz ARM devices shipped in 2012.
ARCHITECTURE Mali Utgard In 2011, ARM revenues were almost half a billion dollars and profits roughly a fifth
of a billion dollars — despite it being, in the delicate phrase of the annual report, a
“challenging year,” with sovereign debt worries and semiconductor industry income
slowing in each quarter. In March, Japan was hit by an infrastructure-damaging
earthquake. Many factories had to halt or slow manufacture for months — which had a
big effect on all sectors of the electronics industry. In October, Thailand suffered major
flooding. Businesses were forced to close in more than 50 provinces. Many of them
manufactured critical components for 45 percent of the world’s hard disk drives.
Yet the number of ARM chips shipped rose to 7.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent
on the previous year. Of those, 1.1 billion were microcontrollers, then ARM’s fastest-
growing market. The number of ARM-based processors in non-mobile devices grew
by 50 percent. A record new 121 licenses were also signed that year, taking the total
to nearly 850. Microsoft announced that the next version of Windows 8 would run
on ARM processors, as would Office and Internet Explorer. Google announced that
Chrome would work on ARM processors.
In the last quarter of 2011 the first Mali GPUs shipped, for use in smartphones and
digital TVs. Two ARM processor-based servers were announced, by Applied Micro
Circuits and HP, whose chips would be designed by Calxeda. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab
tablet, which used an ARM processor, came to market. “The mobile phone,” said ARM’s
annual report, “is increasingly becoming a mobile computer and is likely to become
one of the main ways that consumers connect to online products and services.”
One of the strongest areas of growth in consumer electronics was in gaming,
which had grown in popularity since the millennium to the point where it was greater
than the music and movie industries’ worldwide profits combined. In 2011, ARM
announced its big.LITTLE processing system, saving up to 70 percent processor energy
consumption in common workload tasks, yet still delivering console-quality gaming.
A high performance processor works alongside a high efficiency processor, allowing
either to take on tasks according to their respective capacities. (The big.LITTLE name is
also something of a symbol of ARM’s own culture and performance: the little company
with a big place in its world.)
There was a strong start to 2012. A record 2 billion ARM-designed processors
shipped in the first quarter, a substantial increase on forecasts. ARM’s 9 percent rise
in profits outperformed the rest of the semiconductor industry as a whole, which
fell overall by 4 percent. By the second quarter, profits were up nearly a quarter, year
on year. Over the year, revenues rose 16 percent, and profits by 41 percent. Average
royalty rates also rose, mainly because chipmakers were starting to put multiple
processor cores into devices. Three-quarters of the world’s smartphones had a
Cortex-A processor in the main chip.
By now there were more than a thousand companies in ARM’s Connected

ABOVE The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was one Community. A quarter of license deals signed in 2012 were with companies taking
of the most successful Android smartphone out their first ARM license. And it was also the year that ARM introduced the 64-bit
launches of 2014 (4.5 million sold in the first
processor technology which would be the spearhead of a drive into the worlds
month). It uses an ARM Mali-T760 GPU and
of enterprise networking and servers. ARM’s 2010 annual report had stated that,
a Cortex-A57 and Cortex -A53 big.LITTLE
cluster. “Servers consume huge amounts of energy. Some of our partners are working on ARM
technology-based chips which they believe can reduce energy by more than half.” The
first ARM 64-bit chips would ship in 2014.
In July 2012 Ian Drew, who had been EVP strategy since August 2011, became ARM’s
chief marketing officer and EVP business development. By night, though, he was
someone else: Ian Drew, farmer, shepherd to 50 rare breed sheep, which he sells to
friends and Michelin-starred restaurants. He has two Twitter handles, one for his ARM
life, one for his sheep world. The second has far more followers. Far, far more.
A typical Drew day starts with 5:30 a.m. phone calls from his Wiltshire home and
finishes, after half a dozen or more meetings, at 9 p.m. Then, in summer at least, he is
out “mowing the fields on the tractor.” He manages to do everything because (he says)
he has ADHD and doesn’t watch TV. Oh, and he only has three or four hours sleep.
In 2013 there were several significant changes to ARM’s leadership. In January, Allen
Wu was appointed president of ARM Greater China. Having worked in Silicon Valley, in
both sales and engineering, he joined ARM in 2004. In September, Jennifer Duvalier
joined ARM as executive vice president, people, after six years at the global events-led
marketing and communications services business, UBM plc.

he’d be interested in leaving his tenured academic post to become the company’s

that ARM thinking was long-term, and in particular, that there was a strategic view of
how to equip the next generation of engineers with the right skills for the modern
economy. A few days later, he was met by a car at Stansted airport and taken to
ARM’s Cambridge headquarters. An outsider to the world of corporate tech business,
the Cambridge atrium was something of a surprise to the academic. It has the look

lunchtime ARM’s CEO will leave his less than stately office and queue for his sandwich
like everyone else.

Many of these chips went into 4G base stations, and represented perfectly what
had become the most significant development between 2010 and 2015 for ARM: the
extension to 64-bit and ARMv8 architecture. They had opened up the server market

company who were in field-programmable gate array technology. The plan had been DESCRIPTION The first ARMv8 LITTLE processor
to license the technology as IP and keep the fabless chip business to kickstart the
configurable microcontroller market, but ARM were outbid by Xilinx at the last minute.
In fact the failure to buy the fabless company proved to be a good thing. Had they
bought it, ARM would have been competing with their own customers. It could have
been the downfall of the company.
The model certainly worked with Falanx Microsystems, though. In 2014, 550 million
Mali chips shipped. There was a Mali in more than 75 percent of Chinese-manufactured
application processors. To many people, the ARM business model is the company’s
biggest asset, because expansion is only limited by imagination. The ARM ecosystem
is unparalleled, with everyone doing their bit, in collaboration. It’s a small company
but its ecosystem scales it up, creating more for — and from — less, making a better
product for the customer. It’s a powerful and extendable business model that could,
perhaps, work in other markets. Not that there’s any desire to try that.
The original founders who decided they would not fabricate made, without
knowing it, a visionary decision in 1990. It’s the original DNA of the company, to which
manufacturers add their own ingredients. That original decision to put collaboration
and working with others at the center of everything, to open up to as large a number
of partners as possible, means that there is no limit to the number of partners that ARM
can work with. Problems that might arise in the industry are faced collaboratively, and
fixed together (pretty much, anyway). Similarly, changes in the desires of the consumer
market are addressed in time to cover all outcomes.
Quite obviously the biggest changes and developments between 2010 and 2015
came in mobile technology, and whereas in 2010 only 3 billion of the 22 billion-unit chip
market went into mobile phones, since then smartphones have become ubiquitous.
And now there are even Wi-Fi-connected Barbie dolls.
As always, Moore’s Law holds. Whereas previously supercomputers had been the
norm, ARM are building a lot of functionality into smaller chips, making them more
efficient and more miniaturized. There are now chips the thickness of a human hair —
less than a square millimeter, barely visible — which are powerful, much more powerful
than the processor used for the Apollo moon landing.
In February 2015, ARM announced its most powerful design to date, the 64-bit
Cortex-A72 processor core. This would put more muscle and drive in the next
generation of smartphones and tablets, particularly when handling gaming. Though it
had twice the performance of its predecessor, the Cortex-A57, the A72 used only about
half the power. It was expected that, by 2016, high-end handhelds would have four
A72s and four Cortex-A53s — that’s eight ARMs in your hand.

ARM Chips
3rd Parties The prospect was described by The Register as “the equivalent of shoving data
center tech into your pocket.”
As ARM’s success continues, the company has had to contend with the attention
of investors and shareholders, among them numerous institutions — just 1 percent of
shares are held by people in the company. As of mid-2015, ARM was telling investors
that the company had a long-term growth story, that it will grow royalties as chips get
used in more products, enabling more ARM technology to be used.
By the time that its 25th anniversary was coming round, ARM had become a
worldwide company, albeit one with a strong British base. Though headquartered
in Cambridge, its UK employees accounted for just 41 percent of the worldwide
workforce, which was housed in 30 offices across 14 countries. By the start of 2015,
headcount had risen by 50 percent from 2010, to around 4,000, across 35 offices in 18
countries.
ARM licenses were even less UK-centered — just 1 percent of the total compared
to 15 percent in Europe, 39 percent in the Asia/Pacific region and 45 percent in North
America. In 1998 by comparison, those figures had been 53 percent US, 31 percent Asia/
Pacific and 16 percent Europe.
That there are no customers for ARM in Cambridge is good for the company.
In the early days the team spent a lot of time in Japan and the US; culturally, the UK
is somewhere between the two. Something of the Japanese idea of consensus has
rubbed off on ARM — even though, at times, it has created a problem. Who takes a
decision? When Mike Inglis (an ARM executive from 2002 to 2013, who left to sail his
boat round the world) had not been at the company that long, he asked, in a meeting,
“When are we going to make a decision?” He was told it had already been taken, half an
hour or so earlier. He just hadn’t noticed. That’s the way decisions were made at ARM.
Many at the company suggest that other people think ARM is much bigger than
it is, but at the same time, it still feels small. In the early days, the company motto,
of sorts, was “Hard work but fun.” It might be more organized now but there is still a
healthy amount of anarchy around the place. ARM is still disrespectful of formality.

s you started reading this sentence, there were, roughly, 7 billion people
in the world. Now there are another 17 or so. Population increases by
2.37 people every second. By the time you reach the end of this chapter,
there will be something like an extra 25,000 or so people you’ll be
sharing our planet with.
In 2014, 65 billion chips were shipped worldwide, although only 33 billion of those
contained processors, of which 12 billion were ARM architecture — a 16 percent
increase on 2013. That is, 37 percent of the world’s processor chips that shipped in
2014 used ARM architecture, up from previous year’s 35 percent. At the same rate of
increase that figure would be 14 billion in 2015.
There are some 125 ARM-powered products shipped every second, many of them
with more than one ARM chip, so that’s even more chips. In the first quarter of 2015,
3.8 billion ARM chips shipped, more than 450 a second. As of mid-2015, ARM-based
chips were entering the world at something like two hundred times the rate of people.
Since you started reading this chapter, more than a thousand ARM chips have gone to
work somewhere.
By 2015 ARM was a truly global company. Head to London Heathrow Terminal 3
on any given Monday and chances are you’ll find at least one ARM executive or
engineer waiting for his or her long-haul flight. (Most likely it will be “his” plane rather
than “hers.” Around 80 percent of ARM engineers are men, compared to an industry
average of 90 percent.)
Low-cost smartphones are now prevalent — many cost less than $100, even
without subsidies. Some cost as little as $35. This has been made possible by ARM’s low
power, high performance technology and partnership business model. The Chinese
Gionee P2S phone, for example, had at its core both an ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and an
ARM Mali-400 GPU.
A 2015 report by IHS Technology said that 72.4 million smartphones had been sold
in China the previous year, up from just 4.6 million in 2013. The report predicted sales
would double again 2015, to 144.1 million, then 219.8 million in 2016 and 298.5 million
in 2017. In February 2015 the online investment site Motley Fool, in a piece titled “Is

using it. Maybe even the word “phone” will go the way of, say, “wireless.” In a speech at
Computex in June 2015, Ian Drew didn’t mention the word “phone” once. Innovation
happens in bursts, not straight lines, and while the Internet has been the burst over the
first ten years of the century, it has led us to the point where nearly everyone wants
to be connected. Half the people in the Western world, when they wake up, check
Facebook or their email before they do anything else — usually even before they get
out of bed.
The opportunity for ARM in the connected world is vast. Devices need to be able
to work all day and so require low power consumption. Both the Internet connection
and the phone need to be fast enough; phones need to be rich, both in terms of
graphics and content. ARM have played a significant part in making that possible.
The company has provided key building blocks for the interconnectivity of mobile
devices globally.
In that February posting, Motley Fool went on to write of ARM, “The group is
innovative, cash-generative, a leader in its field, produces a high return on equity and is
currently sitting on a huge pile of cash — five of the most attractive traits any business
can have.” The piece then looked into the future and added, “as the company now
dominates the smartphone microchip market, ARM is now looking to dominate the
Internet of Things market.”
The phrase “Internet of Things” (IoT) is now in its second decade. It was coined in
1999, by Kevin Ashton, an English entrepreneur and co-founder of MIT’s Auto-ID Labs. BELOW ARM’s focus moves eastwards.

transferred, securely, from phone to phone. In sub-Saharan Africa, farmers can use
their mobile to keep track of crop and livestock prices at market. Phones are also
used to provide education — via both voice and written material — thus lowering the
barrier to knowledge. Businesses have learned how to improve productivity, parents
have learned to prevent and treat childhood diseases.
As of 2015, more than 1.1 billion people were using smartphones and tablets. ARM
predicts that, over the next few years, up to 1 billion more people will get their first
mobile phone or tablet and become “connected.” A further 2 to 3 billion people will
join the connected and global economy by 2025, by which time nearly 80 percent of
all Internet connections could be through mobile devices. Further, of all technologies,
it’s the mobile phone to which people have the strongest attachment. A 2014 study
found people happier to leave home without their wallet than their smartphone. It’s
likely that the words “mobile phone” and “smartphone” will leave the language. A
phone, by definition, will be smart and mobile — as smart and mobile as the person

using radio-frequency identification chips to store and transfer information, securely.
The same year, ARM’s annual report dreamed of the future: “Imagine … ordering
your groceries will have been done by your refrigerator, which will contact the store
directly and arrange automatic delivery. Hooking up the domestic appliances in your
home to the Internet so that you can communicate with them, and they with you, will
certainly be with us in the not too distant future, and ARM will be an enabler of these
developments.”
The Internet of Things began to gain purchase, if at first only as an idea. In 2001,
in an MIT Auto-ID White Paper, D. L. Brock described a vision of a “Smart World.” That
is, “an intelligent infrastructure linking objects, information and people through the
computer network.” He looked forward to creating “open standards, protocols and
languages to facilitate worldwide adoption of this network.” That is the basis for an
Internet of Things.
Yet, the development of the Internet of Things has been slower — far slower
perhaps — than predicted. In the 2010 ARM annual report, CEO Warren East wrote
about washing machines with enough intelligence to decide how much detergent to
use based on how dirty the clothes are, and spin the drum using more energy-efficient
control algorithms. Such technology, though, has taken time to reach the consumer
market. The ARM 2012 report gave a description of what would be needed for the IoT

As part of ARM’s preparation for the future, in January 2014 Simon Segars
led a restructuring of the company, combining all its divisions into one product
development team, led by the president of product groups, Pete Hutton. Since joining
ARM in 2008 Pete had taken responsibility for the development and delivery of all
product groups, including processors, Mali media processors including GPUs, and
Artisan Physical IP.
The same month, ARM’s chairman Sir John Buchanan stepped down for health
reasons. Stuart Chambers, former Pilkington plc chief executive and group chief
executive of Nippon Sheet Glass, joined the board and took over as chairman in March.
That spring, two non-executive directors, Philip Rowley and Eric Meurice, left the
board, while Dr. John Liu, a Chinese national, joined in December. Antonio J. Viana,
who had been at ARM since 1999, became EVP and president of commercial and global
development — he had previously overseen development systems sales in North
America and run the ARM foundry program worldwide. ARM also hired new people:

The company expanded physically too, with a new building at its Cambridge
headquarters. As always, it followed the distinctive ARM layout, which encourages the
casual, informal interactions that have been seen as crucial drivers of innovation since
modern capitalism was talked into life in the coffee houses of 18th-century London.
Because it’s hard enough to get someone to talk to the person at the next desk, and
because ARM gets a lot of synergy between the different things ARM people do, this
building (construction was planned to begin in late 2015, with the intention that people
move in December 2016) will be as open, airy and interconnected as the space allows.
ARM looked to the future in a variety of other ways. One was via the past,
when it became the principal sponsor of the Information Age gallery at London’s
Science Museum. The largest and “most ambitious” of the museum’s galleries, the
Information Age’s permanent exhibit details and explores “innovation in information
and communication technologies” over the past two centuries and more. It takes the
visitor on a journey from cable to telephone, to radio, to computers, to networks, to
the Internet. The gallery was opened on Friday, October 24, 2014 by HM the Queen,
who took a small tech-step of her own that day by sending her first tweet. It read: “It is
a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I
hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.”

ARM also has a partnership with the Smallpiece Trust, a program working with
young teenagers in disadvantaged schools. In collaboration with Smallpiece, Villers
Park Educational Trust and Arkwright Scholarships Trust, ARM is one quarter of the
“four-way partnership” 2020 Scholars’ Program, which is inspiring 300 young people
over the age of 14 toward a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
career, by supporting them through exams and into university.
In late 2014, ARM became one of the three founding partners of the Global Stem
Alliance, an initiative set up and steered by the New York Academy of Sciences.
GSA’s mission is to find the world’s best STEM talent and create a global network
of promising students and noted scientists to produce a new generation of STEM
innovators. It reaches out to 3 million people a year and is committed to increasing
that to an alliance of 1 million students in 100 countries by 2020. It runs after-school
sessions. Scientist volunteers — 100 to 120 of them a year — go to schools to “spread
their love” of biology, physics and technology. “It’s a program that lends itself to the
fun, sometimes yucky, hands-on stuff of science,” said Meghan Groome, executive
director of education and public programs at the New York Academy of Sciences. “It’s
a testament to the character and value of scientists. They really see part of their job as
influencing the next generation.”
ARM is also involved in SimPrints. Developed out of an ARM-hosted hackathon at
The Humanitarian Centre in Cambridge, it offers a solution to the worldwide problem
that a third of all children under 5 have no birth certificate or health records. Among
ARM’s many partners is Zone V, a Cambridge startup founded by Abhi Naha, which

Cambridge 1990
In 1983, Acorn occupied the Waterworks and “silver building” (so-named for its metal-
clad exterior) on the Fulbourn Road, on the outskirts of Cambridge, which is where
Project A began. The “silver building” was intended to be a temporary structure and
designed to last for only 10 years, during which time it was hoped that a new science
park would be built up the hill behind it.
After three years at the Barn in Swaffham, in 1994 ARM moved into to the old Acorn
site. In 1999, we built ARM1, renamed the “silver building” as ARM2, and returned the
Waterworks to Cambridge Water. We have slowly expanded the campus since then,
and took over what became ARM3 and then the next building on the site which, in
honor of Larry Tesler, we named ARM6. We’ve now come nearly full circle, and are
overseeing the construction of two new offices (with planning permission for a third)
on the hill behind the old “silver building,” which will be demolished and the site turned
into a car park. It lasted for more than three times the lifetime it was intended to have,

San Jose, CA 1991
The history of ARM’s presence in Silicon Valley spans several offices across three cities
and began in early 1990, in Los Gatos, south of San Jose, near the foothills of the Santa
Cruz Mountains. The second office opened when we had grown to about six people,
primarily in sales, in a building famous for its massive wooden doors and directly
adjacent to where Netflix was founded. In true ARM fashion, the Los Gatos office was
within stumbling distance of a sports bar where many a “meeting” was held.
With the acquisition of Artisan Components in December 2004, ARM relocated to
Artisan’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, very near the former Moffett Field Air Force base.
When staff levels grew to the point that a second office was needed, unfortunately the
only site available was about a half mile away, and entailed splitting off many functions
to a second location. In January 2009, though, ARM moved to the present site on
Rose Orchard Way, at the very top of San Jose, situated near the adjacent cities of
Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Milpitas and Alviso. Originally a Lockheed Martin warehouse,

The Grenoble site was built in 2004 and hosted SOISIC, a 2001 startup spin-off from the
LETI research laboratory based in the city, founded by Eric Dupont-Nivet and Jean-
Luc Pelloie. SOISIC was initially created to become a fabless company targeting RF
applications such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, etc. using SOI processes. The company
originally had two sites: one in Paris with an RF design team, another in Grenoble with
a digital design team. Several testchips were designed and manufactured by different
partners: OKI, IBM. The lack of SOI Physical IP availability led the founders to focus
and re-orient the company purely on SOI Physical IP development. The RF design
activity was dropped. SOISIC then became the only company offering SOI standard cell
libraries, memory compilers and I/O. When the SOI volume market never showed up,
limiting the company’s development and growth,it led ultimately to the 2006 sale to
ARM. Since then, SOI physical IP has been developed on several process generations
(45, 32, 22, 14 nm), mainly for IBM.

The founding team of nine have worked together for almost 15 years, initially as part of a
dynamic binary translation startup spun out of Manchester University called Transitive —
it most famously delivered Rosetta to Apple, ushering in the new era of Intel Macs. The
team of 14 in 2015 is set to rise to over 20 by the end of 2016. We are on the fourth floor
of a 10-story block built in the 1950s, recently renovated and located in the very heart
of the city. On the ground floor is a Canadian diner that serves Oreo milkshakes and a
sweet doughnut steak burger Scooby-snack. Every meal comes with a free trip to the
hospital. The office space is 3,000 sq ft with a current capacity for 26, and was designed
from scratch according to our specific requirements. We moved into the renovated office
space on January 19, 2014. We have meeting rooms named after locations from sci-fi, and
each one has a model representing its name: for example Gallifrey has a Tardis containing
intergalactic sweets, and Dagobah is home to Master Yoda, who is available for Jedi
training every Tuesday and Thursday at 7:00 p.m. Many of us have completed our training
but some still need to return …

Oulu 2013
Despite the long history between ARM and Nokia — once one of the largest handset
manufacturers in the world — the only ARM office in Finland was opened in 2013
when ARM acquired the small Finnish mesh networking and web technology software
startup Sensinode to boost its IoT offering. The current office was purpose-built back
in the 1990s for a local technology company, and Sensinode moved in during May
2012. The location — in the industrial suburbs of Oulu — might not be the most exotic
but the office does make up for it with other amenities. Due to the rapid increase in
personnel since opening, the current plan is to move into new premises some time in
2016. Although Oulu has only approximately 190,000 inhabitants it has become one of
the hubs for wireless communications research in Europe and has a booming startup
scene. The office staff consists almost exclusively of IoTBU software engineers.
We are the northernmost ARM office in the world, but we’re very friendly and
welcome all visitors with open arms. The office has a unique feature that is considered
to be an essential part of a Finnish culture: a sauna. It’s in regular use for office sauna
